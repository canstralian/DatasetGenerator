To generate a large dataset based on the categories discussed (such as Basic Python, Pythonic Logic, Testing and Debugging, etc.), we can proceed with two main steps:
	1.	Creating a Large Dataset: We’ll expand the dataset to include more prompts for each category. We’ll categorize them as follows:
      •   Basic Python
      •   Pythonic Logic
      •   Testing and Debugging
      •   Data Structures
      •   Algorithmic Thinking
      •   Python Libraries
	2.	Automating the Dataset Generation: We’ll write a Python script that can generate these datasets dynamically, which is useful for creating large datasets to upload to Kaggle or HuggingFace.

Step 1: Expanding the Dataset

Here’s a larger dataset with a range of prompts across different Python-related categories:

Step 2: Automating Dataset Generation in Python

Here’s a Python script that will allow you to generate a large dataset of prompts. The script will randomly select topics and generate prompts based on predefined categories and descriptions.

import random
import json
import csv

# Predefined categories and prompt templates
categories = [
    "Python Basics", "Pythonic Logic", "Testing and Debugging", "Data Structures",
    "Algorithmic Thinking", "Python Libraries"
]

prompt_templates = {
    "Python Basics": [
        "How can I sort a list in Python?",
        "How do I create a class in Python?",
        "How do I handle exceptions in Python using try and except?",
        "What is the difference between a tuple and a list in Python?"
    ],
    "Pythonic Logic": [
        "How can I use a list comprehension to filter even numbers from a list?",
        "What is a decorator in Python?",
        "How can I merge two dictionaries in Python?",
        "How do I use list slicing to reverse a list in Python?"
    ],
    "Testing and Debugging": [
        "How can I test a Python function using unittest?",
        "How do I debug a Python script?",
        "What is the purpose of logging in Python?",
        "How can I measure the execution time of a Python function?"
    ],
    "Data Structures": [
        "How do I use a stack in Python?",
        "How can I implement a queue in Python?",
        "What is a dictionary comprehension?",
        "How do I create and use a set in Python?"
    ],
    "Algorithmic Thinking": [
        "How do I write a function that returns the factorial of a number?",
        "How do I implement a binary search algorithm in Python?",
        "How do I find the greatest common divisor (GCD) in Python?",
        "How can I optimize a sorting algorithm?"
    ],
    "Python Libraries": [
        "What is the use of the map() function in Python?",
        "How do I use the pandas library to manipulate data?",
        "How can I use the requests library in Python?",
        "What is the purpose of the itertools module?"
    ]
}

descriptions = {
    "Python Basics": "Basic Python concepts such as lists, classes, exception handling, etc.",
    "Pythonic Logic": "Efficient Python programming practices, idiomatic usage, and advanced syntax.",
    "Testing and Debugging": "Techniques for testing, debugging, and profiling Python code.",
    "Data Structures": "Various data structures in Python like lists, stacks, queues, etc.",
    "Algorithmic Thinking": "Algorithmic concepts and problem-solving approaches in Python.",
    "Python Libraries": "Usage of Python's built-in libraries for common tasks."
}

# Function to generate random dataset
def generate_dataset(num_entries=100):
    dataset = []
    for _ in range(num_entries):
        category = random.choice(categories)
        prompt = random.choice(prompt_templates[category])
        dataset.append({
            "prompt": prompt,
            "category": category,
            "description": descriptions[category]
        })
    return dataset

# Generate dataset
dataset = generate_dataset(100)

# Save to JSON
with open('python_prompts.json', 'w') as json_file:
    json.dump({"prompts": dataset}, json_file, indent=2)

# Save to CSV
with open('python_prompts.csv', 'w', newline='') as csv_file:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csv_file, fieldnames=["prompt", "category", "description"])
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(dataset)

print("Dataset generated and saved as 'python_prompts.json' and 'python_prompts.csv'.")

How This Script Works:
	1.	Categories & Templates: It defines categories and associated prompt templates.
	2.	Random Selection: It randomly selects a prompt from each category.
	3.	Dataset Generation: The generate_dataset function creates a list of randomly generated prompts.
	4.	Export to JSON & CSV: The script saves the dataset in both JSON and CSV formats.

Usage for Larger Datasets:
   •   You can easily modify the num_entries parameter in the generate_dataset() function to generate as many entries as you need (e.g., for Kaggle or HuggingFace).
   •   The dataset can be expanded by adding more categories or prompt templates.
